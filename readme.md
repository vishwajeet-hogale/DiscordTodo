# Discord bot to keep track of your todo list

This project deals with the creation of a discord bot using discord js
which helps users to keep a track of their todo tasks on a daily basis.

This bot is made using python. This bot helps you to keep track of all your daily tasks. Initially, this bot is going going to add, modify and delete your todos. I have made this bot for myself so that I can keep a track of my tasks. Later on, after a few months I'm going to use all the data stored to analyse my prime working hours, number of hours spent in doing tasks, types of tasks that was time consuming,etc.

As of now, this is a simple bot that implements the functioning of a todo list.
